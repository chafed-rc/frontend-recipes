# 🥘 Frontend Recipe – Animations & UI Playground

Welcome to **Frontend Recipe**, a personal project built for practicing frontend animations and sharing cool, reusable UI components with the dev community.

Here you'll find small, focused components using:

- ⚡ **Framer Motion** – For delightful, interactive animations  
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – For utility-first, clean styling  
- ⚛️ **React (TypeScript)** – For strongly-typed, component-driven UIs  

The goal is simple:
> **Practice. Improve. Share.**  
Build components that look great, feel smooth, and are easy to reuse — and drop tips & demos on Twitter to help others too.
